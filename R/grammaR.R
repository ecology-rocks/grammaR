#' Package "grammaR": Recursively generated text and story writing with R
#'
#' This package was built to help a hobby writer write things better using code.
#' We often reuse phrases and words -- this package helps us generate a
#' dictionary and use that dictionary to vary our words. So, "he said" becomes
#' "he smiled" and "fear" becomes "distress", and before you know it, you have a
#' brand new story.
#'
#' There are a few different functions that may be helpful to you. You can use
#' the \code{\link{makeNewDictionary}} command to interactively build your first
#' dictionary; you can use the \code{\link{makeGrammarFromStory}} function to
#' build a starting grammar, by paragraph, for your newest story, and you can
#' use \code{\link{spinStory}} to find matching values between your dictionary
#' and your story to spin.
