Description: This is a helper package for people wanting to create a
  context-free grammar to generate documents. This package relies on
  several helper languages, including Perl and OCaml, as well as the
  command line tools ImageMagick and PanDoc. Depending on your desired
  output, you may also need LaTeX. This package streamlines grammar
  construction, allows you to generate documents from your grammar, and
  also allows you to dynamically build e-book covers using ImageMagick.
